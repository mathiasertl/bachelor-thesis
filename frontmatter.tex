\chapter{Preface}
\tunix is a Linux distribution customized to fit the needs of students who study
computer science at the Technical University of Vienna. \tunix is based on
Ubuntu, a popular Linux distribution designed for the desktop, which is in turn
based on the Debian Project.

\tunix has a yearly release schedule and is developed each year by two different 
computer science students together with AO.Univ.Prof.\ Dr.\ Peter Purgathofer. 
This is the documentation on what has been done and how in the second
edition of \tunix, released in September, 2006. In this year, \tunix was developed
by Mathias Ertl and Florian Cech. This document is split into 4 parts:
\begin{description}
\item[Chapter 1] gives you an idea of what \tunix is.
\item[Chapter 2] is a collection of ideas and concepts of what could be (and only
partly was) done with \tunix.
\item[Chapter 3] explains the process of remastering an Ubuntu live-CD.
\item[Chapter 4] explains DPKG-packages and APT-repositories
\item[Chapter 5] describes the actual changes done to \tunix.
