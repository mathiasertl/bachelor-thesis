bachelor-thesis
===============

My bachelor-thesis on TUn!x.

TU!nix once was an Ubuntu-based live cd customized for students at the Vienna University of Technology. The last release was based on Ubuntu 6.06, Dapper Drake.

You can still find the (only historic) homepage of the project here: https://tunix.fsinf.at/wiki/Willkommen_zu_TUn!x
